To run:
	from the shell...
		[chmod +x pml.py] then run [./pml.py]
		or simply run [python pml.py]

	*** ensure the index.pml file is in the same directory as the pml.py script ***

Assumtions:
	* It is assumed that the value assigned to the "pml" variable is the return value in the <pml></pml> block
		reason: The stdout stream required me to print rather than return a value.  I also could not return inside the pml without hacking together a wrapper function for every pml. 

	* Is is assumed that the <pml> and </pml> tags should be on separate lines.  I modified the code to enable single line <pml></pml> statements for a single python statement, but no other tags can be present outside the <pml> or </pml> on the same line unless they are in a string inside the pml block.
